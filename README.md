#### Things to Work On
I will continue to work minimizing the delayed response the webpage has by editing my Javascript, and finding a way to loop all options in one, rather than creating five different event listeners. In addition, I will make the page more responsive, and add more dimensions to the page: such as a drop down menu with featured planets, species, people, etc.
